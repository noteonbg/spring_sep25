ask?

1. name.
2. years of experience.
3. expectation from the training program.
4. how is life with code generation tools..   thoughts...


----------------------------

0. know your folder structure..
where will your project folders be present, which is project folder, which is not.
know which java version do you have, which maven version do you have..


1. ensure springproject is copied  in your working folder and see whether it works.

2. ensure springbootproject is copied, in your working folder and see whether it works.

3. open .m2 folder. and see the location
homefolder\.m2\repository\com\h2database\h2\2.3.232 , do you see h2xxx.jar

4. come to the command prompt and check is h2 running or not..

5. create a database called training_poc.db... 
5.1 h2 should be running   java -jar h2xxx.jar
5.2 come to another command prompt and type.  java -cp h2.jar org.h2.tools.Shell
database name give it as jdbc:h2:./whateverdatabasename


-------------------------------------------------------

approach.

we will understand existing code, and then try logic on new problem statement..


6. think how many files you need to create for a project... and what is basis for decision.

7. in a new project put all the spring related dependancies and see whether it works..

8. there is  a folder called a01archcode in the src/main/java , try to figure out what it is  and move the code into appropriate packages
and make it work.. is it a spring or spring boot related project.

9. a02accscenario unerstand the code.. and add a functionality called updateAccount .. think which all files needs to change
and why, how.. and do it..

10. convert the a01archcode and a02accscenario into spring based code.

11. understand the code in a04configuration, a05lifeccle, a06messageresourceevents, a07stereotypes, 08properties, and a09qualifieer packages.

12. a10spring jdbc adventure code, understand it and implement the jdbc in a01archcode and a02accscenario packages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13. now think of the a02casestudy.txt and what will be your packages and 
get a jdbc implementation done on the case study.

14. convert that into jpa code..


15. run the packages in spring boot project  
a00xxx to a03basicxx.. there are bugs in the a02basicpoc
and a03com.poc.. in the adding investment controller
function fix it.

16. run the package a04onetoone_mapping and see
how it works...
add a mechanism to add a citizen information and adhar
card details and also provide a mechanism to
change the person name and age. all the layers
need to reflect the same.
